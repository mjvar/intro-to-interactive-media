# Assignment 2 - Procedural Map Generation with Voronoi Tessellations

This Processing sketch generates maps (for use in games, Dungeons & Dragons campaigns, etc.) from Voronoi tessellations. This was a really interesting project to work on!

1. Voronoi Tessellations
To start, what is a Voronoi tessellation? Essentially, it's a plane partitioned into regions based on any given point's closeness to a given set of objects. For the purposes of this project, I randomly plotted points on the canvas, and generated Voronoi tessellations from those:
