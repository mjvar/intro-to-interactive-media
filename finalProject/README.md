# Final Project: Sonar DJ

Sonar DJ is an interactive electronic music kit. 

### November 25

A distance sensor is mounted on a servo. The area in front of the distance scanner is the "audio space", which is a labelled mat with different channels. When you put cubes on different parts of each channel and hit SCAN, the distance scanner scans its surroundings and plays music based on the positions of the cubes.

My idea right now is for the audio space to have 4 different channels, where each channel controls a particular part of the music (as of now, beat, bass, chords, and melody). I also want to add more expressive ways to vary sounds, maybe with different kinds of sensors.

Finished the basic physical prototype of the scanner! Mounting a breadboard onto a tiny servo, with a bunch of wires messily stuck on, makes stable motion and sensing quite difficult. Major takeaway from today: large amounts of Blu-Tack can solve anything.

I did have an idea for the instrument. Instead of having cubes on a mat that you just move around, it would be cool to control the instrument by moving your hands across the mat. This makes the instrument less likely to be played for longer periods of time, since people's hands will probably get tired. Plus, having human hands on the mat instead of cubes will make sensing much less accurate. I'll sleep on it and think about what makes sense.
